Project Idea Description


* Maintaining proper quality of water is extremely important in today’s world considering its extreme shortage. Fabricating a device that gives a correct indication of the level of water pollution based on significant parameters such as pH, the temperature will help understand the quality of local water bodies.

* This device will not only indicate the water quality but it will provide structured data on the fish that can be bred and the vegetation that can be grown in a particular water body. Hence monitoring water quality can be performed by people in a more localized and effective way. This will immensely help with the fish culture which is already a very important domain in India. 

* Indian fisheries and aquaculture is an important sector of food production providing nutritional security, besides livelihood support and gainful employment to more than 14 million people, and contributing to agricultural exports. The major facets include freshwater and inland fisheries along with coastal aquaculture. Owing to India’s vast domain in fisheries, it is important to ensure the development of this domain in the coming years. 

* Hence there is dire need to maintain water quality in order to ensure the proper fish culture in India and to uphold the standards of water quality


*These objectives are achieved by PONDer, by ensuring a real time water quality management
